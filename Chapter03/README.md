# Kubernetes Workout - Chapter 3

This GitHub directory is according to **Chapter 3** of the book *Kubernetes Workout*.  
This chapter has two subfolders: `lab3` and `lab4`.

- **`lab3`** contains all the code listings discussed in the book.  
  It also includes `lab3.yaml`, which is the final Kubernetes Pod manifest used in the chapter.

- **`lab4`** is an exercise for the reader.  
  It contains solutions to the practice problems described at the end of the chapter.

## Notes

* All manifests are tested with `minikube` but should work in any conformant Kubernetes cluster.
* Namespace `chapter3` is used consistently to avoid interference with other labs.
* Use `lab4/` to cross-check your answers for the chapter-end exercises.
